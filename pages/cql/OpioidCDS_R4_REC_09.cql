/*
**
**  Recommendation #9
**    Clinicians should review the patientâ€™s history of controlled substance
**    prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data
**    to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or dangerous
**    combinations that put him or her at high risk for overdose. Clinicians
**    should review PDMP data when starting opioid therapy for chronic pain
**    and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, ranging from
**    every prescription to every 3 months
**    (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4).
