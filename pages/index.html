  <p>
      This implementation guide provides resources and discussion in support of applying the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Opioid Prescribing Guidelines:
  </p>

  <a href="https://guidelines.gov/summaries/summary/50153/cdc-guideline-for-prescribing-opioids-for-chronic-pain---united-states-2016#420">CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain</a>

  <p>
      This implementation guide was developed as part of the Clinical Quality Framework Initiative,
      a public-private public-private partnership sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
      Services (CMS) and the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
      (ONC) to identify, develop, and harmonize standards for clinical decision support and electronic
      clinical quality measurement.
  </p>

  <p>
      This project is a joint effort by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
      Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) focused on improving processes for the
      development of standardized, shareable, computable decision support artifacts using the CDC Opioid
      Prescribing Guideline as a model case.

  <p>The initial target recommendations for the project are:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><a href="recommendation-04.html">Recommendation #4 - Opioid Release Rate When Starting Opioid Therapy</a></li>
      <li><a href="recommendation-05.html">Recommendation #5 - Lowest Effective Dose</a></li>
      <li><a href="recommendation-07.html">Recommendation #7 - Opioid Therapy Risk Assessment</a></li>
      <li><a href="recommendation-08.html">Recommendation #8 - Naloxone Consideration</a></li>
      <li><a href="recommendation-10.html">Recommendation #10 - Urine Drug Testing</a></li>
      <li><a href="recommendation-11.html">Recommendation #11 - Concurrent Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
      Prior review by Yale Center for Medical Informatics had identified these recommendations
      as the most implementable using the Guideline Implementability Appraisal (GLIA) form.
      MME will be quite challenging to implement, but also is expected to provide significant
      value to healthcare organizations due to the complexity of the logic which would make it
      difficult to re-implement on an institution-by-institution basis.
  </p>
  <p>
      Recommendation #4 (starting on short-acting opioids) is difficult to implement because
      identifying new opioid prescriptions for chronic pain is challenging (specifically, such
      therapy often starts out with an intention to treat acute pain).
      Recommendation #11 (opioid-benzo interaction checking) is difficult to implement due to
      overlap with existing drug-drug interaction checking software and the lack of further
      specificity in the guidelines (e.g., for specific drug combinations over a certain dosage
      and for specific populations such as the elderly).
