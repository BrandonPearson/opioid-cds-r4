<h2>
    CDC Opioid Prescribing Guidelines - Integration Documentation
</h2>

<p>This section describes how recommendation #5 is implemented in terms of FHIR Clinical
  Reasoning Module resources and CQL libraries, as well as how those resources can be
  implemented within a FHIR server for integration with an EHR via CDS Hooks.</p>
  
<h3>Overall Approach</h3>

<p>Once the flow has been established for a recommendation, it can be represented in
  Clinical Reasoning resources, typically using a PlanDefinition resource to build
  Event-Condition-Action rules.</p>
  
<img src="assets/images/Recommendation05-Flow.png"/>

<p>The orange starting point for the flow indicates the point at which a clinician is
  prescribing a medication for a patient. The next steps in green involve determinations
  based on the input data, evaluating the criteria for whether or not the event meets the
  condition. If the condition is met, the yellow action steps are performed to created the
  guidance and return it to the EHR for presentation to the user, and, in this case, 
  prompting a response from the clinician.</p>
  
<p>The structural information to represent the Event-Condition-Action rule is described
  in a PlanDefinition resource, while the logic components (the steps in green) are represented
  in a CQL library. These components are then used in an overall approach as depicted below:</p>
  
<img src="assets/images/ClinicalReasoningApproach.png"/>

<p>Briefly, the EHR invokes the "medication-prescribe" hook at the appropriate point in the
  prescription workflow. The CDS Service is called via the CDS Hooks API and passed the
  medication being prescribed along with the patient information. The CDS Service then 
  processes the appropriate PlanDefinition resource, evaluating the criteria and constructing
  a response as a CarePlan/RequestGroup if the criteria evaluate to true.</p>
  
<h3>Clinical Reasoning Resources</h3>

<p>As described in the previous section, recommendation #5 is represented in Clnical Reasoning
  resources using a PlanDefinition and several Library resources:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>plandefinition-cdc-opioid-05 - Captures the structure of the Event-Condition-Action rule defining the interaction.</li>
  <li>library-opioidcds-stu3 - Contains the CQL for the STU3 version of the opioid CDS expressions. This library references the OMTKLogic library.</li>
  <li>library-omtklogic - Contains Opioid Management Terminology Knowledge (OMTK) logic used to calculate MME equivalence.</li>
  <li>library-omtk-modelinfo - Contains the OMTK model info referenced by the OMTK logic.</li>
</ul>

<h4>PlanDefinition</h4>

<p>The PlanDefinition is the starting point for the representation of the recommendation and defines the
  triggering event in the EHR, the condition that must evaluate to true for the guidance to be returned, as
  well as the actual guidance to be returned.</p>

<h5>Event</h5>
  
<p>The <i>event</i> is represented using the triggerDefinition element of the PlanDefinition:</p>

<div class="example">
  <pre class="xml">
&lt;triggerDefinition&gt;
	&lt;type value="named-event"/&gt;
	&lt;eventName value="medication-prescribe"/&gt;
&lt;/triggerDefinition&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

<p>The name "medication-prescribe" defines the "hook" to be used from the EHR.</p>

<h5>Condition</h5>

<p>The <i>condition</i> is specified with the condition element and identifies a named
   expression defined within the CQL library:</p>

<div class="example">
  <pre class="xml">
&lt;condition&gt;
	&lt;kind value="applicability"/&gt;
	&lt;description value="Is total MME &gt;= 50?"/&gt;
	&lt;language value="text/cql"/&gt;
	&lt;expression value="IsMME50OrMore"/&gt;
&lt;/condition>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>The value of the expression element references an expression defined in the library for the PlanDefinition:</p>

<div class="example">
  <pre class="xml">
&lt;library&gt;
	&lt;reference value="Library/opioidcds-stu3"/&gt;
&lt;/library&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

<h5>Action</h5>

<p>The expression returns a true or false, indicating whether the condition is satisfied. If the
  condition is satisfied, the <i>actions</i> are defined as a group with a behavior of "exactly-one",
  indicating that the user is required to select one and only one of the options:</p>
  
<div class="example">
  <pre class="xml">
&lt;selectionBehavior value="exactly-one"/&gt;
&lt;action&gt;
	&lt;description value="Will reduce dosage"/&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;
&lt;action&gt;
	&lt;description value="Risk of overdose carefully considered and outweighed by benefit; snooze 3 mo"/&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;
&lt;action&gt;
	&lt;description value="Acute pain; snooze 1 mo"/&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;
&lt;action&gt;
	&lt;description value="N/A - see comment (will be reviewed by medical director); snooze 3 mo"/&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Note that the as of the time of this writing, the CDS Hooks specification does not support notifying
  the CDS Service of how the user responded, only that they responded. This issue is actively being addressed as
  part of the specification. In lieu of CDS Hooks support, the local EHR integration should provide
  this functionality.</p>

<h5>Representing GRADEs for the Recommendation</h5>

<p>The Opioid Management Guideline uses the GRADE approach to describing the quality of evidence and
  strength of the resulting recommendations. Within the Clinical Reasoning module, this information is
  represented using the cqif-qualityOfEvidence and cqif-strengthOfRecommendation extensions:</p>
  
<div class="example">
  <pre class="xml">
&lt;extension url="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-strengthOfRecommendation"&gt;
	&lt;valueCodeableConcept&gt;
		&lt;coding&gt;
			&lt;system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/recommendation-strength"/&gt;
			&lt;code value="strong"/&gt;
			&lt;display value="Strong"/&gt;
		&lt;/coding&gt;
	&lt;/valueCodeableConcept&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;extension url="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-qualityOfEvidence"&gt;
	&lt;valueCodeableConcept&gt;
		&lt;coding&gt;
			&lt;system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/evidence-quality"/&gt;
			&lt;code value="low"/&gt;
			&lt;display value="Low quality"/&gt;
		&lt;/coding&gt;
	&lt;/valueCodeableConcept&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

<p>The Clinical Reasoning module defines default terminologies for these, based on the GRADE scales, so
  these defaults are used. If more control over the exact text of the grading is needed, specific bindings could
  be defined and used instead with the same extensions.</p>
  
<h4>Opioid CDS STU3 Library</h4>

<p>This library contains the STU3 logic used by the PlanDefinition to establish the condition, as well
  as to dynamically construct the guidance so that it reflects the data for the current patient.</p>

<h4>Opioid Management Terminology Knowledge (OMTK) Library</h4>

<p>This library contains the Opioid Management Terminology Knowledge (OMTK) logic that performs the
  actual MME calculation. This logic is built in a separate library to enable to be reused from different
  contexts. In particular, the same OMTK library can be used with STU3 and DSTU2 versions of the Opioid CDS 
  library if necessary.</p>
  
<p>The library requires the use of the OMTK solution component, a knowledge base derived from RxNorm and other
  standardized terminologies. Use of this component is described in more detail in the implementation documentation.</p>

<h4>Opioid Management Terminology Knowledge (OMTK) Model Info</h4>

<p>This library defines the structure of the OMTK solution component so that it can be used within CQL.</p>
